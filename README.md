####Remote console
Follow these steps to connect to remote console:

#####VNC
* Install bVNC from Google Play
* Click console button in VM Detail view

#####SPICE
* Install aSPICE(v3.7.7+) from Google Play Store
* Click console button in VM Detail view

####Augmented Reality  
You can use your smartphone/tablet camera to help managing your servers. Follow these steps to access augmented reality:

1. Generate Data Matrix codes for each host you running (this step will be simplified in future).
  * Open `http://host:port/ovirt-engine/api/hosts` in your browser and find host ID.  
    <img src = /images/data_matrix_guide/Screenshot_1.jpg align="center">
  * Make data matrix codes with any online generator containing these IDs as a text (one code for each ID).  
    <img src = /images/data_matrix_guide/Screenshot_2.jpg align="center">
2. Print and stick codes to physical servers.
3. Open Scan Codes option in moVirt and you are ready.

###Developer's guide:        
To start contributing to moVirt, you will need to **install** the following things  
For **Windows** users:

* Download and install [Android Studio Bundle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
* Add packages in Android SDK Manager ([guide](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html)), you need:
  * Android SDK Platform-tools
  * Android SDK Build-tools v.20 and 21.*.
  * Android Support Library and Repository
  * Android API 20 SDK (you can install additional SDK as per your needs).

For **Linux/MacOS** users:

* Download [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other)
* Download and install [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other) or any other IDE for Java development.
* Install Android SDK ([guide](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html))
* Add packages in Android SDK Manager ([guide](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html)), you need:
  * Android SDK Platform-tools
  * Android SDK Build-tools v.20 and 21.*.
  * Android Support Library and Repository
  * Android API 20 SDK (you can install additional SDK as per your needs).

Once the installations are done, you can proceed to **import the project** into the workspace.

1. This step only for Windows users.
  * Before importing you need to change symlink. To do this run CMD with admin rights, change directory with `cd [/d] path\to\movirt\root`, and run `symlink.bat`. Repeat every time after updating repo.
  * Also you might want to exclude symlink from your local repo. To do this add `AndroidManifest.xml` to the end of `.git\info\exclude` file.
2. File -> Open -> ~/" *path to moVirt project* "/build.gradle. Or select "Import project" from Welcome page.  
3. On the import dialog : Select local gradle distribution. Give the path to gradle version 2.2.1.      
   <img src = /images/import_project.png align="center" height = "480px" width="640px">    
   After this, the prompt asks you to enter the path to the android sdk.  
   You can refer the following image for the complete SDK path.    
   <img src = /images/sdk_location.png align="center" height = "480px" width="640px">    
4. Press OK. The build takes a while to complete. After it is done, the project is reloaded.  
5. Run the android application on an emulator or a developer's device.  
    Run -> Run -> Select moVirt-moVirt   
      *For the first time* Run -> Edit Configurations  
      Click on the + icon -> Android application -> in right panel General tab select the moVirt-moVirt module.  
      Click Apply. Click OK.
